# Copilot Instructions

## Shared Instructions

Shared Copilot instructions, skills and prompts are maintained centrally in the [.github](https://github.com/f2calv/.github) repository, under `.github/instructions/`, `.github/skills/` and `.github/prompts/`. They are deliberately not copied into this repository, so a change there takes effect everywhere without a pull request here.

To load them, clone that repository and either add it to this VS Code workspace, or link its folders into `~/.copilot/`. Its README explains both.

If those shared files are not visible, stop and tell the user rather than guessing the conventions — this repository depends on them.

Everything below is specific to this repository.

## Cluster Identifiers

A cluster rebuild issues a new API server endpoint and, where the caller attaches one, a new ingress address. Record such out-of-band follow-up steps in the root `README.md` rather than leaving them implicit for consumers.
